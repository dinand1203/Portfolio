I love combining creative thinking with technology, so an idea doesn’t just look good — it actually works well too. For me, the challenge is creating digital products that feel intuitive, are enjoyable to use, and look strong at the same time.",
            "paragraph2": "In my work, I focus on the full picture: from concept and visual design to interaction and implementation. I enjoy refining details like animations, micro-interactions, and user flow, because those small touches often make an experience feel complete. I always try to make choices that fit the goal of the project and the people who will use it.",
            "paragraph3": "Alongside design, I’m actively growing my development skills. I’m constantly learning more about web development and building interactive digital experiences. In this portfolio, I share projects where I explore how design and code can work together. Each project is a chance for me to try something new, improve my skills, and create digital experiences that are not only functional, but also memorable."

I created a realistic glass shader with proper refraction and transparency, designed a three-point lighting setup to highlight the product, and carefully composed the scene to guide the viewer's eye. Finally, I enhanced the colors and contrast in Photoshop to prepare the visual for use in professional marketing campaign materials.",

Met deze webapp kunnen gebruikers snel sterke wachtwoorden maken en ze makkelijk aanpassen, bijvoorbeeld door de lengte te veranderen of bepaalde tekens wel/niet toe te staan. Ik heb extra aandacht besteed aan een interface die er strak uitziet en fijn werkt, zodat je zonder gedoe een veilig wachtwoord kunt genereren."

                    "text2": "In de applicatie gebruik ik React Hooks om de instellingen bij te houden en het wachtwoord direct te updaten zodra je iets aanpast. Je kunt realtime spelen met opties zoals lengte en welke karaktersets je wilt gebruiken, zodat je precies krijgt wat je nodig hebt.",
